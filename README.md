GridLinker:

Gridlinker is a web puzzle game developed with react.js, developed as a personal project to improve my react.js and javascript knowledge.
The game can be played here: https://gridlinker.web.app/

How to play:
-The game consists of a grid of boxes containing (hidden) random numbers
-When a box is selected the number in the box is added to the score, and the numbers in the surrounding boxes are revealed
-The aim of the game is to select boxes to draw a path from the top of the grid to the bottom with the lowest possible score
-All players are given the same grid, which resets daily, and can compare their scores on a global leaderboard

This repo contains the frontend for gridLinker. GridLinker is deployed as a firebase app.
